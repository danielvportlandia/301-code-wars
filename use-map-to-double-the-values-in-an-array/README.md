Problem Domain: Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.

Answer: The first parameter of map is the 'element' of the array, which I used the ES6 arrow function to add each element to itself, thus doubling the array values.
